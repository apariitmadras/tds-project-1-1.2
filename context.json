From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.But one critical subject that\u2019s rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?These tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you\u2019ll have to scrape them yourself.You learn how to train models. But soon, you\u2019ll just pick something from HuggingFace.You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a sed + grep script in minutes. \u201cWe lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You\u2019ll have to decode the regexes yourself.\u201dIn this course, we\u2019ve curated the most important tools people use in data science.Learn them well. You\u2019ll be a lot more productive than your peers.\n\n\nThis course is quite hard\n\nHere\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:It used to be an easy course until 2024.\n#\n#\n#Now it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n#\n#\n#Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n#\n#\n#LLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably.\n#\n#The ROE is hard.\n#Take Graded assignment 1 to check if you\u2019re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.\n\n\nProgramming skills are a pre-requisite\n\nYou need a good understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.But isn\u2019t this a data science course? Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don\u2019t just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.In some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, some of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.This course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you do need programming to learn many of them.\n\n\nWe encourage learning by sharing\n\nYou CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).Why should you copy? Because in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.To learn well, understand what you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.To learn better, teach what you\u2019ve learnt.\n\nWe cover 7 modules in 12 weeksThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the commit history for changes.Released content:Development Tools and concepts to build models and apps. Discussion ThreadDeployment Tools and concepts to publish what you built. Discussion ThreadLarge Language Models that make your work easier and your apps smarter.
